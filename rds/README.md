# Service Catalog RDS Reference Architecture

This reference architecture demonstrates how an organization can leverage Serivce Catalog to provide Amazon Relation Database Service (RDS) databases testing and integration..  

## Getting Started

When implemented this reference architecture creates a Service Catalog Portfolio called "Service Catalog RDS Reference Architecture" with four associated products.  The Service Catalog Products reference RDS database cloudformation templates for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL which can be lauched by end users through Service Catalog as either single instance databases or multi-availability zone databases.
